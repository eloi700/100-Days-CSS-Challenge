            SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a pre-processor
            scripting language that will be compiled or interpreted into CSS.
            SassScript is itself a scripting language whereas SCSS is the main
            syntax for the SASS which builds on top of the existing CSS syntax.

        <button class="quest q2">What is SCSS used for?</button>

            SCSS is a special type of file for SASS, a program written in Ruby
            that assembles CSS style sheets for a browser. SCSS is like CSS with
            better formatting. Being an extension of CSS3, in SCSS, we can add
            nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more.

            It facilitates you to write clean, easy and less CSS in a program
            construct. It contains fewer codes so you can write CSS quicker. It
            has very good documentation, meaning that you can get all the
            required information online. It provides nesting so you can use
            nested syntax.

            When it comes to the domain of styling web pages, we have the choice
            of using plain CSS or SCSS in a project (among other preprocessors).
            SCSS is a superset of CSS. Most developers find it more convenient
            to use it over CSS due to its advanced features and clearer syntax.
