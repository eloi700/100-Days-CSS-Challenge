# 100-Days-Challenge

These are the challenges from CodePen for 100 consecutive days.
It is fantastic to get into these challenges to practice my coding skills as well as to keep my mind alive and awake.
The challenges include design or animation every day for 100 days straight. It encourages me to explore different techniques and design styles.

As I progressed through the challenge, I did not only enhance my CSS skills but also develop a consistent design aesthetic and increase my creativity. I was able to experiment with new and interesting ideas and develop a deeper understanding of CSS.

The challenge is perfect for anyone looking to improve their CSS skills, whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer. You can participate in the challenge alone or as part of a community, sharing your designs and getting feedback from other participants.

Happy coding, everyone!
